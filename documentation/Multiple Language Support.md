# Multiple Language Support

We supports multiple language integration throughout the admin portal.
User will get language switcher on the top right of the Appbar.

 
### Implementation:
####  You'll need language files for all the supported files in JSON format. For example: 

*For English JSON:* english.json
```jsx
  {
		"ra":{
			"actions":{
				"add": "Add",
				"remove": "Remove"
			}
		}
	}
```
*For French JSON:* french.json
```jsx
 {
		"ra":{
				"actions":{
					"add": "Ajouter",
					"remove": "Supprimer"
			}
		}
	}
```


####  After this, you'll need to import and include these files into the `i18nProvider` in `src/App.js` as follows:
  
  ```jsx
  const frenchMessages = require('./french.JSON'); //path to french language JSON file
	const englishMessages = require('./english.JSON'); //path to french language JSON file
    const messages = {  
        fr: frenchMessages,  
	    en: englishMessages,  
    };
  ```
In Above sample, fr and en are the language codes which will be used as the identifiers of the language. Messages object will be supplied to `i18nProvider` as follows
```jsx
const i18nProvider = polyglotI18nProvider(locale => messages[locale], 'en');
```
Here we are using [`polyglotI18nProvider`](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/blob/master/docs/Translation.md) for i18n and setting `'en'` as the default language.

Once you are done with setting up the provider, you just need to include it in the `<Admin>` and `<Provider>` selectors as follows,

 ``` jsx
  const App = () => {  
        return (  
            <Provider  
      store={createAdminStore({  
                    authProvider,  
      history,  
      i18nProvider,  
      dataProvider,  
      })}  
            >  
     <MuiThemeProvider theme={createMuiTheme(theme)}>  
     <Admin  i18nProvider={i18nProvider}  
                        catchAll={Error404Page}  
                        appLayout={CustomLayout}  
                        authProvider={authProvider}
                        ...
 ```

Now you can move forward to add languages in `config.json` in `src/`
For example: 

``` jsx
...
"languages": [  
  {  
      "id": "en",  
      "title": "English",  
      "flag": "us"  
  },  
  {  
      "id": "fr",  
      "title": "French",  
      "flag": "fr"  
  }  
]
...
```

Here we have 2 languages, **French** and **English** with following parameters:

 - "id" : language identifier // Should be same as in the messages object
 - "title" : lable, which will be visible in the language switcher on the top right of Appbar
 - "flag" : (optional) This will be the name of flag for the language to display in language switcher. You will have to save these flag files (as png) in `public/assets/images/flags/`  

### Usage: 
All the translation of texts inside the `<Admin>` selector will be taken care of automatically by the react-admin. But you'll have to implement all other translations by yourself and you can translate static text as well as dynamic text through translation provider as follows:

```jsx
import { translate } from "react-admin";
...
<div>{translate("ra.actions.add")}</div>
...
```

Translation provider will pick the language file according to the selected language and will look for property `ra.actions.add` and will display the value of that propery dynamically.
